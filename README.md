## Post-Apocalypse George (text game)
(NOTE: Tested on Win11 only, no plans for portability.)

A text-based concept for a game idea I had, called Post-Apocalypse George. Made with C++ to expand my knowledge.

For this project, I will start with the following as its foundation:
  - Save files
  - Level navigation (fast travel)
  - Dynamic command recognition and responses

I'll start with a prototype. I don't have a concrete plan for the flow of the game.

### What is with that title?
Frankly, I don't know. I played [Game Dev Tycoon](https://www.greenheartgames.com/app/game-dev-tycoon/) and I chose to "create" a post apocalypse-based game. I started the title with "Post-Apocalyptic" and after a few seconds of consideration, arbitrarily ended the title with "George." I thought it was funny for some reason, and it stuck with me, though I did change it to "Post-Apocalypse" since it makes slightly more sense. I guess.
